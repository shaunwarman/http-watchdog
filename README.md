> A simple http watchdog to monitor app health

## Overview
This watchdog is a side car container that sits next to your application process / container. The watchdog is
configured via an environment file or direct environment variables injected into the container at startup. From there, the watchdog polls the health of your application and sends alerts after a variable number of failures.
